## Schematic

Here is a basic schematic showing the overall design of the original AAS.

                                   +---------------+ 
                                   |    MPU6050    | 
                                   | Accelerometer | 
                                   +-------|-------+ 
                                           |         
                                           |         
                                           |         
         +-----------+             +-------v-------+ 
         | MPL3115A2 |             |    RP2040     | 
         | Altimeter -------------->     CPU       | 
         +-----------+             +-------|-------+ 
                                           |         
                                           |         
                                           |         
                                   +-------v-------+ 
                                   | Flash Storage | 
                                   |      2MB      | 
                                   +---------------+ 

**N.B.** The original flash size was 2MB - changed to 8MB after the first launch due to its insufficient size.
This system takes 20 sensor readings per second, which are stored in flash storage.

See [this commit](https://github.com/icl-art/avionics/commit/b56d4629c624b6bab54ca2577aa3f64e02a82ea5) for the code used in the first launch.

Here is the (tentative) schematic for the second iteration of the AAS.

      +---------------+             +---------+                    
      |  ICM-20649    |             | BMP390  |                    
      | Accelerometer -------+      |Altimeter|

      +---------------+      |           |                         
                             |           |                         
      +---------------+      |      +----v----+         +---------+
      |    BNO085     -------+------> RP2040  ----------> PAM8302 |
      | Accelerometer |             |  CPU    |         | Speaker |
      +---------------+             +----|----+         +---------+
                                         |                         
                                         |                         
                                         |                         
                                 +-------v-------+                 
                                 | Flash Storage |                 
                                 |      8MB      |                 
                                 +---------------+                 

Note: only one of the 2 accelerometers will be used.

Key differences:

* Either the BNO085 or ICM-20649 will replace the MPU6050
* The BMP390 will replace the MPL3115A2
* The PAM8302 speaker was added to assist in recovery

### Code

The avionics system is a 3 state, state machine, with the following states:

1. Pre flight - 10 seconds of data is recorded in the ring buffer (see below) - Next state when launch has been detected
2. Mid flight - Data is continuously recorded and written to flash memory - Next state when flash is full, or the rocket has landed.
3. Post flight - No more data is recorded and the recorded data can be accessed via a usb connection.

This system records data in the following format using 32 bit floating point numbers.

    0 1          31 32         63 64         95 96                                    191 192                                   287 288
     +-------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
     |             |             |             |           Linear Acceleration           |         Rotational Acceleration         |
     | Time offset |  Pressure   | Temperature +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
     |             |             |             |      x      |       y     |      z      |      x      |       y     |      z      |
     +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
    0 1          31 32         63 64         95 96        127 128       159 160       191 192       223 224       255 256       287 288

So each record uses 36 bytes, and since 20 records are taken per second, 720 bytes are needed to record 1 second of flight.
The simulated flight takes 120 seconds, which means that 86,400 bytes are used for the flight, which is significantly lower than 2MB.


The above calculation does not factor time spent at the launch pad, and the time taken to recover the rocket, which increases the data stored significantly.
One method of reducing the data is to trigger data recording at launch, using the accelerometer to detect launch.

However, some data may not be recorded as there is time between the actual launch and launch detection. This is fixed by using a ring buffer of 10 seconds of data.

The above diagram illustrates the ring buffer concept, the numbers indicate the record order (note these are dummy numbers).

---

During the first launch, 2 things went wrong with this method.

1. The system was programmed to only collect 120 seconds of data.
2. The accelerometer was triggered early.

Luckily it seems that the rocket launched soon after the incorrect detection, so some data was recovered.

### Performance hacks

* Writing to flash is much slower than writing to RAM, so we actually store the data in a buffer in RAM, and periodically flush it to flash.

* The RP2040 has Programmable IO and a DMA controller which means that the each sensor can write to the RAM buffer in parallel with other sensors. (Note this may need custom drivers for the sensors)

* The RP2040 has 2 cores, so we use 2 buffers, Buf 0 is used by Core 0, to write records into, and Buf 1 is written into flash by Core 1. When Buf 0 is full and Core 1 is finished, the buffers are swapped.

## Testing

The following parts can be unit tested:

* Ring buffer
* Data encoding/decoding

Since the rest of the system is tightly coupled with the hardware, the avionics bay will need to be tested before launch.

Tests include:

* It is impossible to trigger launch detection without an actual launch. This could be done by shaking the assembly.

* The data collected from the sensors is accurate. This could be done by manually triggering a launch event, and moving with the avionics bay.

## Launch procedures
1. Power the avionics bay using a LiPo
2. Place the jumper on the outer 2 pins
3. Place the bay on a level surface and wait for it to make a sound.
4. If it plays the Mii Channel Theme -> an old log file is still on the pico, so remove it and restart at 1.Otherwise the Nokia theme should play.
5. The pico will start recording data in 15 minutes, when the Nokia theme plays again. It will record for 5 minutes before switching to recovery mode.
6. Recovery mode is indicated by the Mario Theme playing in a loop, it is now safe to unplug the pico and read the data
